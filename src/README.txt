To start the program, compile the MyProtocol.java, then execute the MyProtocol, giving as argument a unique integer between 0 and 3 (inclusive).
If this integer is not unique, someone else will get your messages as well.
If this integer is not between 0 and 3, it will be taken modulo 4.
Wait until the available nodes are present before sending the messages.
